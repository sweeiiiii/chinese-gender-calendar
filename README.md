## 📖 About

**Chinese Gender Calendar** is a cultural micro tool that predicts a baby's gender based on the mother's age and the month of conception, using a traditional Chinese chart often known as the “清宫图” (Qing Palace Chart). While it’s not scientifically proven, it has been a popular curiosity across generations — and now it's online, modern, and mobile-friendly.
